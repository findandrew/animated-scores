SCORE NOTES

For 3-6 performers
Any instrumentation
Duration ~12 minutes

Each row is intended for one performer. One row may be shared by multiple performers in the case of an ensemble larger than a quartet, or ignored in the case of a group smaller than a quartet.

The x-axis coresponds to pitch or range. The far right being the highest of an instrument's range and the far left being the lowest of ones range. Think 'keyboard' and it should make sense.

The opacity of each moving element coresponds to dynamic. Full opacity being the upper dynamic range and zero opacity being total silence.

Color is an optional paramater, which coresponds to stylistic approach. It is recommended that the performer identify three styles to anchor to yellow, orange, and blue (the predominant colors in the piece).

Each performer is encouraged to improvise within the pitch range, dynamic approximation, and stylistic approach captured by the element on their row. As the element changes, the performer is encouraged to adjust their improvisation accordingly.

To view the piece, open this file in a web browser. An up to date version of Google Chrome is recommended.

Have fun!
