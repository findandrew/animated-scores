- `sets` are collections of scores
- `score_systems` are collections of modules that can be combined to create scores which are all interpreted the same way. Each score system musically interprets a 2D space in it's own way
- `scores` are pieces that can be played on their own
- `design_studies` are studies on color, movement, shape, etc. These are not necessarily intended to be performed, but can inform or inspire individual scores
